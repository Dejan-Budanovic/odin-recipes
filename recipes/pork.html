    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>TFor this peach-stuffed pork chops recipe, I'm going to show you my favorite technique for stuffing pork chops, as well as one of my favorite stuffings for pork. Above and beyond producing something that's visually impressive, we are also flavoring our pork chops from the inside out with this method. So, this is basically a technique video and will work no matter what stuffing you decide to use—although this peach stuffing is absolutely delicious. </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>2 strips bacon, sliced into ¼-inch pieces</li>
        <li>½ cup diced onion</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons diced poblano pepper</li>
        <li>1 large yellow peach, peeled, pitted, and diced</li>
        <li>8 saltine crackers, crushed</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chicken broth, or as needed (Optional)</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) with oven rack in center position. </li>
        <li>Cook bacon in a nonstick skillet over medium heat until almost crisp, about 5 minutes. Add onion and poblano pepper; cook until onion turns translucent, 5 to 6 minutes. Add peach; cook until tender and starting to render some juice. Transfer to a bowl. </li>
        <li>tir saltines, thyme, black pepper, ¼ teaspoon salt, and cayenne pepper into peach mixture; add 2 tablespoons chicken broth to moisten as needed. Refrigerate until ready to use. </li>
        <li>Lay pork chops flat onto your work surface. Cut a pocket in center of each pork chop, starting with a small incision on fat side of chops, exactly halfway down, using the tip of a knife to cut as close to the edges as possible without poking through. Try to make pocket incisions at least 2 inches wide. </li>
        <li>Fill pockets with peach stuffing, packing and pressing in firmly; season both sides chops with salt. </li>
        <li>LHeat olive oil in an oven-safe skillet over high heat. Add chops; sear until browned on one side, about 3 minutes. Carefully flip chops and transfer skillet to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until an instant-read thermometer inserted into centers reads 145 degrees F to 150 degrees F (63 to 66 degrees C), about 15 minutes. </li>
        <li>Transfer chops to a plate; cover loosely with aluminum foil. </li>
        <li>Return the skillet to the stovetop; place a towel over the hot handle. Add ¼ cup chicken broth and balsamic vinegar; bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon. Off heat, stir in butter. Taste; adjust seasoning if desired. Serve sauce over pork chops. </li>
    </ul>
